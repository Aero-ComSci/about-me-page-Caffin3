    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <h2>Career Goals</h2>
    <!--Three different positive character traits-->
    <p style="color:rgb(130, 142, 174); font-size: large;">The art of successfully fabricating one's objective that would otherwise only be located within one's mind is a thrill that I seek out in my daily life. I strive to achieve great things using my unmatched creativity to make this world a more colorful, unified place. I want to pursue a career that allows me to embrace the abstractions in my mind and turn them into a reality. In order to meet these expectations I have placed upon myself, I plan to volunteer and participate in leadership positions, such as teacher's assistants and public speaking roles. This will hone my ability to converse with my peers and teammates and efficiently work with them to complete our tasks to their fullest potential. I want to have a career like this because I want to use my talents to help our society in a way that I enjoy. I strive to not just survive but live. I want to enjoy my life and help others enjoy theirs as well.</p>
